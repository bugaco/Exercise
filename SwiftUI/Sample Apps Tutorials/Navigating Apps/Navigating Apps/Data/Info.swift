"On March 25, 2020, when India went into a nationwide lockdown, all schools, colleges, and tuition centres had to follow suit. What followed was an unprecedented rise of online education‚Äîpropelled by the need of the hour‚Äîand the sensational growth of India‚Äôs edtech sector.
    
    In a year when funding was supposed to recede due to investors becoming cautious, edtech startups in India raised a record $2.2 billion, leading the deal volume for the first time. This momentum continued in 2021 as well, with ÔªøBYJU'SÔªø alone raising $1 billion-plus in funding.

    The edtech major also became India‚Äôs most valuable startup last June‚Äîat a valuation of $16 billion‚Äîand is currently valued at over $22 billion.

    ÔªøUnacademyÔªø, another leading edtech player in the country, also saw a meteoric rise in its valuation, up by 70 percent from $2 billion in November 2020 to $3.44 billion in August 2021.

    It really did seem like online education was here to stay, forever.

    But in 2022, life came full circle for the sector.
